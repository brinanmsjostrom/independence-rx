    <p>
    Independence RX began initially as a project by me, Brinan Sjostrom, to gather and share knowledge about self-reliance, freedom, and the dangers of big technology. Over time, my hope is that it will grow into a community effort.
    </p>

    <p>
    I believe that every step toward self-reliance is a step toward freedom. The system we live under are designed to create dependency and offering a solution to problems it created in the first place. By reclaiming the ability to cook, build, grow, repair, and prepare, we reduce that dependency and expand our freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
    This site is meant to be a resource: practical, open, and shared freely. I hope you find something here that empowers you to live more independently.
